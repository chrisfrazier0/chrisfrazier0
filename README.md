## 🚀 My Latest Project

[CrabScript][latest-repo] is an interpreted language that I am developing in Rust, designed for performance and memory
safety without garbage collection. It supports high-order functions, closures, block-scoped variables, references, and
more, making it versatile hobby language with interesting uses. [CrabScript][latest-repo] leverages Rust’s memory
guarantees to ensure robust performance while delivering a clean and expressive syntax.
